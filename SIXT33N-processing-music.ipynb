    "In this phase you will merge the microphone front-end circuit and the PCA classification that you built in the last phase. You will re-record sample data, now using your own microphone circuit. You will then re-run the PCA classification and, when you think it is good enough, implement it in the Launchpad. The Launchpad will print out the genre it identifies when you play some music. Since this phase requires both the circuit and the PCA components, one of the students working on this phase should be from the team that worked on the circuit and the other student from the team that worked on the PCA classification.\n",

    "In the previous section, you got a feel for which genres are easy to distinguish between. Now that you have chosen two genres, you will have to collect your real training data. You cannot use your old data because the noise and filtering of the micboard will be different from the front end you just built. You will have to collect a new final set of data, and you will want to collect more data for this stage than you did before.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to replace the micboard with your newly breadboarded mic circuit. Just as in the PCA phase, disconnect the 5V jumper on the Launchpad, because you will power the Launchpad from the power supply. <b>Make sure to keep the jumper on just the pin closest to the USB and put it back at the end of the lab.</b> Do not power up your circuit for now, we will connect the appropriate Launchpad pins to your circuit first:\n",

You should not need to modify anything - just run the whole notebook and evaluate the final clustering results. Are the genres clustering well? Is your classification accuracy still high enough? If your accuracy was previously very high but it is now much lower, you may have over fit your data. You may need to tweak some of your preprocessing in order to get good enough accuracy again.

    "Your last step will be to implement your <b>data processing</b> and <b>classification</b> (just the projection, not the PCA) in the Launchpad sketch <b>`classify.ino`</b>. Energia uses the Arduino language, which is very close to C. If you need a refresher or a quick start, there are many C tutorials in the web. Since Energia does not have as many in-built functions as Python, you might have to write out the functions yourself. For example, a dot product should be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`float result = 0;`<br/>\n",
    "`for (i=0; i<LENGTH; i++){`<br/>\n",
    "&emsp; `result += vector1[i]*vector2[i];`<br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "The main code in the Launchad sketch runs in a function called `loop()`. As its name suggests, the function gets called forever in a loop. This is the function where you will write most of your code. The first `if` statement in `loop()` checks if the data collection array is full, and if it is, performs a DFT on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before **`CODE BLOCK B`**, the real and imaginary parts of the DFT are placed into two separate arrays named `re` and `im` when `fix_fft()` is called. This is the data that you will be working with. You will also note that a variable called loudness is also calculated above Block B. You will not have to use loudness yet, but you will need to use in in the final integration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code in  **`CODE BLOCK B`** to reflect the signal processing from the PCA classification phase. The built-in function `sqrt` might help. Remember that to project the processed data, you should subtract the data with the mean, then do a dot product with the new basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, write some code to classify the resulting projection. This should be some simple `if` statements. If a genre is identified, print out the genre name in Serial.\n",

Now upload the sketch to your Launchpad and run it. Open the Serial Monitor and press the reset button. Play a genre and the Launchpad should recognize it as it gets printed on the Serial Monitor! Make sure the LEDs turn on and off properly too.\n",
